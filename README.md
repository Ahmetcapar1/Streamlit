# F1 Events App
Due to my problems in computer, I have 3 different python file. In the Drivers.py, I get the drivers' information from API and store it in F1Drivers.csv. In Events.py, I get the events data and create data.csv. In the streamlit.py, I read the data from that csv files, and in some events there is driver_number information also, so I matched driver_number with the Drivers' name_acronym from F1Drivers.csv and replace the driver_number column of data.csv with a new column which named driver and contain driver's acronym.
